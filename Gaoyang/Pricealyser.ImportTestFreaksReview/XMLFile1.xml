        <title>Canon EOS 1200D review</title>
        <extract>The entry-level DSLR market has slowed in terms of product releases in recent years. Indeed it's taken three years for Canon to out the 1200D - that's Rebel T5 for our American friends - and while we don't mind waiting for the right kit to come along we do question whether the market has changed...</extract>
        <pros>Decent viewfinder-based performance for entry-level product, impressive image quality throughout, huge range of EOS lenses available, competitive price</pros>
        <cons>Live view is poor, JPEG processing is a little harsh, plasticky build, compact system cameras may undermine its existence, kit lens limitations</cons>

        <pros>Affordable, Textured coating, Optical viewfinder, If price is the key determining factor for your first DLSR purchase, then the 1200D is an extremely attractive proposition. For a good price, you get great image quality in a classic DSLR like package, along with the full support of the Canon range...</pros>
        <cons>Slow focusing in Live View, No touchscreen, No Wi-Fi/NFC, The biggest problem with the 1200D is that it's just not that exciting. Having waited for three years for an upgrade to the 1100D , it would have been nice to see some more audacious specs, such as built-in Wi-Fi, or perhaps a higher...</cons>

        <title>Does not have self cleaning sensor!</title>
        <extract>This is a good camera for beginners or for those who cannot afford the slightly expensive range cameras. However I must point out that this does not have a self cleaning sensor. When I tried changing lens, some dust/oil got onto the lens and was constantly showing a grey spot on all images.</extract>

        <title>Worth Buying</title>
        <extract>Compared to most cameras today, the Canon EOS 1200D isn't the most premium or high grade. For this price, it isn't meant to be but it is still more expensive than your average camera especially with the EF-S 55-250 IS II lens bundled.</extract>

        <title>A Bit Expensive</title>
        <extract>Advanced point and shoot cameras have been stepping up to the terrain offered by DSLRs. Their price and ease of use is helping them compete with the likes of Canon and Nikon which are known for their high prices.</extract>
